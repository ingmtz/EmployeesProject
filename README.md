# Daimler Truck | Employees
## _By Ing. Arturo Mart√≠nez_




The 'Employees' project is a practical evaluation designed for a job application at Daimler. It comprises a frontend developed using Angular 15 and a backend powered by ASP.NET Core Web API technology.


## Backend Features

- The project employs Entity Framework as anticipated.
- I have incorporated the repository pattern to facilitate seamless database source replacement, should the need arise.
- The project extensively utilizes Dependency Injection to enhance reusability, maintainability, and alignment with best practices.
- Each endpoint is equipped with comprehensive HTTP responses, complemented by the correct HTTP verbs to align with its specific functionality.
- Valuable libraries like AutoMapper and JsonPatchDocument are leveraged to maintain code cleanliness and efficiency.
- Finally, I have implemented Entity Framework Core Migrations to both create tables and populate them with exemplary records.

## Frontend Features

- It effectively consumes backend services.
- The project leverages Bootstrap to enhance design aesthetics and ensure responsiveness.
- The application meticulously segregates functionalities into individual components.


## TO DO

I am eager to implement the following enhancements:

- Improved Error and Confirmation Messages: I plan to integrate a robust library for displaying elegant and informative messages to enhance the user experience.
- Exploring ASP.NET Core Identity: I am actively researching ASP.NET Core Identity, a technology that has piqued my interest due to its potential benefits.
- Configuring GitHub Actions for Automated Deployments: I intend to set up GitHub Actions to streamline the deployment process, improving efficiency.
- Project Implementation: I made an attempt to configure a VPS with Docker containers for project deployment. However, due to network limitations and time constraints, I was unable to complete this task.


## Thank you

Thank you for the opportunity to be considered for this application. I am eager to meet and exceed your expectations. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
